# Pen & Paper - Might and Magic
[\[Deutsch\]](README_de.md)

Pen & Paper - Might and Magic is a set of rules for magic based role-play adventures. 
It is based on the set of rules of ["How to be a hero"](https://howtobeahero.de/index.php?title=Hauptseite), 
but heavily simplified and modified in order to include systems for magic, level and armor.

[Additionally, it provides lore for the "Might and Magic"-Universe, as well as pre-defined skills, spells, armor, 
character-sheets and resources such as the character template.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vlGbauQldnZ9hNkznQclgl-a3T1Ws5faECuhnaYWpCw/edit#gid=0)
