# Character creation
The player plays a fictional character in this fictional world. 
The character may act and behave completely different from the player.

*New players are advised to choose traits that are not the complete opposite of their natural behavior, 
because it may be too hard to play the character to the fullest.*

## Preparation
Before you start thinking about all the skills that your character may have, 
think about why your character is who he is and why he is that way.
This will help you to understand the traits of your character and thus improves your role-play.

*New players should choose some stereo type, such as a brawler or a scientist.*

Start by thinking about a name, age and how your character looks like.
After that you start thinking about the traits of your character.
Traits are patterns of behavior that define how and why your character acts the way he acts.
To name some traits: Being prideful, envious, merciless, selfish, shy or sadistic.
Lastly you choose a race fitting your traits, or a race, which does not fit at all.
This depends entirely on the kind of character you want to play.

Now you have to fill your character with a life.
Likewise to reality, a character is a product of everything that has happened to him in his life.
Therefore, you have to think about a detailed background story, which explains the hardships your character has gone through, 
which ultimately explain the traits of your character.
This will help you and your fellow players to understand your character.
Thus, write a DIN A4 page about your character.
Do not be shy to write about the characters emotions.

## Life points
Every character has 100 life points (given this is not influenced by any advantage or disadvantage).
Your character passes out if the life points fall below 10. 
When they reach 0, your character dies.

## Advantages and disadvantages
Characters may be extra ordinary.
Thus, they may not fit into the description of the respective race, nor into an otherwise usual character.

You can give your character special advantages and/or disadvantages.
Please negotiate with the game master how many skill points you need to spend for it, 
or how many skill points you gain for giving your character such a disadvantage.
The amount of skill points depends on how impactful the advantage or disadvantage is.
For example, a spider phobia is not as bad as being hated in the whole country.

The player is expected to act in his role-play according to these advantages or disadvantages.
The game master may remove those advantages or disadvantages if the player does not adhere.

## Skill points
Every character may spend up to 400 skill points on skills in three designated categories: **Acting**, **Knowledge** and **Social**.
Additionally, up to 100 magic points may be spent on magic-attributes or spells.

Only give your character skills that fit its description. 
Everything else is considered **power-play** and not **role-play**.
If your character does not have a particular skill to master a challenge, 
you have to role a trial on the respective category, in which the skill would otherwise be assigned to. 
The points in the category are calculated as the sum of all points in this category, divided by 10.
The result is rounded.

The effective value of your skill is the sum of the points in that skill and the points in the category.

## Skills
All skills are separated into on of three categories: **Acting**, **Knowledge** or **Social**.

**Definition Acting:** Something your character actively and physically does. For example, climbing or swordsmanship.

**Definition Knowledge:** Something which is primarily about knowing something. For example, Herbalism or history.

**Definition Social:** Everything that is used to interact with other characters in the world. For example, lying or intimidating.

A skill is a special ability that your character can do. 
A character must have a specific skill to master challenges that fit to its respective description. 
If a character does not have the respective skill, a trial must be roled on the points in the respective category.

For skills regarding magic, please see the chapter **Magic**.
