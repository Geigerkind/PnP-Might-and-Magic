# Combat system
The combat system is based on round robin system.
Every action must be executed after another.
The order depends on the **initiative** of a character.
The **initiative** is the sum of the value in *Action* and the result of a D10 dice roll.

The attackers may act first if they attack a character, or the group by surprise.
An action is about 4 to 8 seconds in-game time.

## Attacking
The first requirement to attack a target is to be in range. 
If this is the case, a trial may be attempted to evaluate if an attack succeeded.
The chance to pass such a trial depends on the respective skill that was used.

For example, if a character wants to hit the target with a  two-hand mace, a trial with the skill "two-hand maces" must be passed.

## Defending
Every round a physical attack may be averted if the attack was not a critical success.
With no special skill, a trial on *Action* must be passed.
The game master may choose to decrease the difficulty or to impose more difficulty.
If an attack was averted successfully, the character takes no damage from this attack.
If the defending character has to block with his body, he will still take half the original damage.

Magical attacks can be mitigated with other magical attacks. 
When two offensive spells hit each other, the potency of the spells are compared.
If the potency of the defender's spell is at least as high as the potency of the attacker's spell, 
then the attacker's spell is completely mitigated.
Otherwise, the defender will take damage to the value of the difference of the compared spells.

Spells may also be dodged. 
If the player wants to dodge a spell, a proper justification has to be given.
If granted, proper role-play is expected.

Fast attacks, like firearms do, or particularly fast magical attacks may only be attempted to be defended under special circumstances.
The game master may decide to impose significant difficulty in such cases.

## Damage
The caused damage depends on the used weapon or spell. A critical success doubles the caused damage.
