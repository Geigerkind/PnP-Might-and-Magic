# Dragon
The dragons are one of the oldest races in the history.
They are guardians of the world's secrets.
Normally, they are not interested in mortal affairs.
However, if the world looms to be in existential risk, the dragons intervene to restore stability in the world.
They are able to transform into humanoid form.
While in humanoid form, they carry smaller wings, clear scales are visible on their skin, and they have cat-like eyes.
