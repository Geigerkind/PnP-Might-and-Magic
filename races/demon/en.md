# Demons
Demons are feared by most races, because they mercilessly murdered and ate other races while looting their homes.
Especially humans dislike humans, because they were affected the most by their raids. 
For demons, humans were an easy target because they are comparably weak compared to other races.
In recent times, the demon leader decided to change the image of the demons and cleanse their reputation.
However, many conservative demons oppose this new movement.
