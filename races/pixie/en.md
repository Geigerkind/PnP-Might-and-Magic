# Pixie
Pixies are small, humanoid creatures that are oftentimes also called fairies or spirits.
They specialize in support magic, and most of the times look for a powerful partner (of another race), 
whom they follow on their adventures until their partner eventually dies. 
Because of their high life expectancy, Pixies tend to have several partners in their lifetime.
However, due to their small body, they tend to have a small magical capacity.
They have developed an unique ability though, that allows them to cast powerful magic with their partner.

## Advantages
Pixies can share the mana-pool and half of one magical attribute of each of their partners (except of other Pixies) in the vicinity.
Please see "Pixie-Symbiosis" in the spell table.

## Disadvantages
* Resistance against physical attacks extremely reduced (see affinity).
* Potency of physical attacks (against other races) extremely reduced (only 25% of the original value).
* 25% less health points.
* 50% less mana.
* Pixies can't carry a lot.
