# Dice system
In order to successfully execute an action, such as a skill, a **trial** must be passed.
The game master will ask for a specific trial for a specific action.
For each trial a **D100 dice** must be used.
A 1 is considered very good, and a 100 is considered very bad.

If the value of the dice roll for a trial is between 100 and 90, then the trial is considered a **critical failure**.
If the character has a skill above 90 for the respective trial, 
then the threshold for a critical failure is between 100 and the respective points in the skill.
A 100 is always considered a critical failure, regardless of the skill.
The lower 10% of the skill are considered a **critical success**.

The potency of weapons, shields or spells can depend on other dices.
For all dice rolls with dices that are not a D100, dice rolls may be repeated if the maximal dice number was rolled.
