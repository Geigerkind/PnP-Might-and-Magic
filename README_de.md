# Pen & Paper - Might and Magic
[\[English\]](README.md)

Pen & Paper - Might and Magic is a set of rules for magic based role-play adventures. 
It is based on the set of rules of ["How to be a hero"](https://howtobeahero.de/index.php?title=Hauptseite), 
but heavily simplified and modified in order to include systems for magic, level and armor.

Additionally, it provides lore for the "Might and Magic"-Universe, as well as pre-defined skills, spells, armor, 
character-sheets and resources such as the character template.
